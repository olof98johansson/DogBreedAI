# DogBreedAI (Still in progress)
First frontend project of a minor web application to predict different dog breeds based on photos from the gallery/right from the camera. 

<hr>

Initially using pretrained [ResNeXt](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431) as classification network, but also created a customized ResNeXt aswell as an ensmble network of different ResNet and ResNeXt architectures to be trained. The dataset was collected from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data) consisting of 120 different dog breeds with a total size of 10222 images. As the official amount of total breeds, according to FCI, is [360](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/canine-corner/201305/how-many-breeds-dogs-are-there-in-the-world), the model covers a third of the entire species.
